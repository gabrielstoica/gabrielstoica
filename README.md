For the last 4 years I thrive at the intersection of decentralization, privacy, and usability, working on creating bridges between web2 and web3 worlds. Whether itâ€™s designing seamless blockchain integrations, crafting smart contracts, or building end-to-end dApps, Iâ€™m always searching for ways to make web3 more accessible.
