I design and build secure, scalable smart contracts and decentralized applications (w/ Solidity, Typescrit & Rust), pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology. Passionate about on-chain identity, payments, and decentralized operations, Iâ€™m actively exploring Account Abstraction, ZK proofs, FHE, and DeFi innovations to help shape the future of Web3.
